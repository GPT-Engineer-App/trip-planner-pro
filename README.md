Create an app that supports the following uses stories:

Homepage/Dashboard

View Trip Itinerary: The homepage or dashboard serves as an overview page where users can view their upcoming trip itineraries. Each trip summary includes links to view detailed itineraries, edit, or delete the trip.
Plan a Trip Page

Plan a Trip: A dedicated page for creating a new trip. Users can specify the destination, start and end dates, and add a list of activities or places they wish to visit. This page should include form fields for inputting these details and a submit button to save the trip.
Trip Details Page

Edit a Trip: On the trip details page, where the full itinerary is displayed, include an "Edit" button that allows users to modify the destination, dates, and activities of their trip.
Delete a Trip: Also on the trip details page, provide a "Delete" button that enables users to remove the trip from their itinerary list, with a confirmation prompt to avoid accidental deletions.
Checklist Page

Add Travel Checklist: A checklist page where users can create and manage checklists for their trips, such as packing lists or pre-departure tasks. This page should allow users to add new items, edit existing ones, and organize them by categories if needed.
Currency Converter Tool (Accessible via Dashboard or Sidebar)

Mark Checklist Items: Within the Checklist Page, users can mark items as completed. This functionality helps users track their preparation progress directly on the checklist.
Local Language Phrases Page

Language Phrases: A page dedicated to providing users with a list of common phrases in the local language of their destination. This page could be organized by categories such as greetings, directions, dining, and emergencies.
Emergency Contacts Page

Emergency Contacts: A section where users can store and access a list of emergency contacts, including local emergency services, embassy information, and personal emergency contacts.
Weather Forecast Page

Share Itinerary Functionality
Share Itinerary: Integrated within the Trip Details Page, include an option to share the itinerary. 

This is a prototype but please sure you implement ALL the user stories, mocking and using dummy data when possible. We will validate the prototype by running through EVERY SINGLE user story, so we should be able to complete every single task.
